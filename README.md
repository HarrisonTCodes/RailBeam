# RailBeam

App to view live UK train journeys, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

To run the app locally, you will need an OpenLDBWS token from [Rail Data Marketplace](https://raildata.org.uk/).

(However, you can test it without an access token, simply remove the access token URL parameter from all huxley requests in the API)
